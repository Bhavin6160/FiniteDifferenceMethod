# FiniteDifferenceMethod
This is the MATLAB and Python Code, containing the solution of Laplace Equation of 2D steady state Heat Conduction Equation using Various FDM Techniques. This code was written by me under for my course work project.
This code includes following Methods
#Jacobian
#Gauss-Siedel
#PointSuccessiveRelaxation (PSOR & PSUR)


Note : For Python code to run you'll require the matplotlib and numPy libraries.
